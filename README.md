## Dependencies

* **curses** for rendering terminal UI
* **pyglet** for audio support
* **AVbin** (pyglet depency)

## Known Issues

* AVbin throws an exception after playing multiple files
* Some files cannot be played (float exception)
* Playlists that exceed the length of the terminal window's height will crash the application

## To Do (Project Management)

* Organize project directory into a more "pythonic" structure
* Include requirements file

## To Do (Development)

* UI does not refresh continuously (seek bar / timestamp do not update continuously)
* Playlist scrolling
* Track queueing (currently only a single track will play)
* Shuffle / repeat mode
* Browse directory
* Add files recursively
* Add files in specified directory (only current directory is supported)
